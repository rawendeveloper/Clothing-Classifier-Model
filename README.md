# 👗 E-Commerce Clothing Classifier Model 👚

## 🌟 Overview

This project focuses on an **E-Commerce Clothing Classifier Model** developed using **PyTorch**. The model is designed to categorize clothing items into distinct classes based on product images, such as **T-shirts**, **Dresses**, **Pants**, and **Shoes**. The classifier can help online retail platforms automatically label products, improving user search experience and inventory management.

The project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract visual features and predict the correct category, providing an essential tool for modern e-commerce platforms to automate classification processes.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The clothing classifier is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which includes:

- **Conv2D & MaxPooling Layers**: To extract spatial features and reduce the dimensionality of the image.
- **Dropout Layer**: Applied to avoid overfitting during training.
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**: For final classification into clothing categories.
- **Softmax Output Layer**: To output the probabilities for each clothing category.

The model is trained on a custom dataset with images of different clothing categories labeled accordingly.
